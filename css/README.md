title: CSS
---

This directory holds all the CSS for the theme.

It is organised following Drupal standards:
 - `base` (CSS for elements) - also includes the variables.css file
 - `layout` (grid system and macro layout items)
 - `components` (CSS specific to design components) - most of our CSS is here
 - `state` and `theme` directories are not included, to simplify things.
