  @file Theming for localgovdrupal/localgov_eu_cookie_compliance
  
  This has been included to avoid the cookie compliance integration
  having a dependency on the base theme's variables for styling. By
  including this here, there will be sensible behaviour out-of-the-box.
  
  End-users can override these styles in their descendant themes, if needed.

  This uses the .lgd-region path to increase specificity over that
  included in the compliance module, as when using LGD this is
  rendered within .lgd-region.lgd-region--content-top
